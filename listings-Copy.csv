I have managed a range of holiday properties, from budget to boutique, for the last 10 years giving me unique knowledge and insight to match the needs and expectations of guests and property owners alike.
Please see the range of extra services and recommendations offered, including hampers and styling advice. 

For Guests: 
I understand different people have different needs when it comes to booking a holiday, I offer a personalised service for each of my guests. I understand and respect all guests have specific expectations and endeavour to match guests with appropriate properties. Correspondence and confirmation is available by phone, text and email.
All my properties supply linen; sheets, pillow cases, bath towels, bath mats, hand towels and tea towels. You only need to bring your beach towel, although we can arrange hire of these too!
Properties are fully self-contained with complete kitchens, outdoor BBQ, laundries, bedrooms and lounge/dining rooms. Some include private yards, balconies and unrivalled views. 
Units, duplexes and houses are all available, depending on your requirements and preferences in Fingal Bay, Shoal Bay and Fisherman’s Bay.
Since moving to Port Stephens whale watching has become a passion for me, whether I’m watching from the shoreline or on board a whale watching charter. Whale season is between June and October, with dolphins inspiring us all year round. 
Fisherman’s Bay: You can sit on the balcony or in the lounge room and see the whales come by, a truly magnificent site.
Pet Friendly: Some family members have paws, if that’s your family take a look at our Fingal Bay property. There’s even a nearby dog park!
Hampers: Picnic baskets, gift boxes and fresh flowers can also be organised for your special occasion, anniversary, birthday or just because you want something a bit special. Charter bookings for dolphin/whale watch cruises and deep sea fishing can also be organised.
All properties are professionally cleaned prior to your arrival. Check in is easy so you can enjoy your stay as soon as you arrive.
For Owners:
I have lived in Port Stephens for over 25 years and have managed over 180 holiday properties in the last 10 years. I have experience in what does and does not work in our local market and provide advice to all my owners for setting up a holiday property to balance the needs and wants of owners and guests. My management style is friendly and personalised for each owner, providing regular updates, statements and payments. 
Your property is unique, just like you, and I believe when you enhance the property’s personality you encourage guests to return to your property for future holidays in the Bay.
