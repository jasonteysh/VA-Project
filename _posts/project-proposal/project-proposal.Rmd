# Background
Airbnb, Inc. is one of the most well-known vacation rental platforms in the world. With almost 3 million hosts listing over 7 million accommodations worldwide, airbnb is popular with holidaymakers for the wide availability of rental accommodations.

# Motivation
A common challenge for many hosts is how to price their listing competitively compared to other listings in the same locale. This project aims to provide an application for airbnb hosts to identify whether they their prices are comparative to other accommodations, or too high/low.

The abundance of Airbnb data provides us with a great opportunity to analyse clusters and geospatial clustering of rental units within Australia. It also allows us to review variables that lead towards better reviews and pricing through multilinear regression, and text analysis.

Such analysis could benefit both potential hosts, and also policymakers, to ensure there is a balance between commercial and residential units in the property market.

# Project Objectives
* Develop an interactive application for end-users
* Visual representation of accommodation listings by region

# Timeline of Project
Our project timeline will be as follows

The methodology that will be used are:</br>

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</br>
* Cluster Analysis</br>
* Text Analytics</br>
* Development of an R-shiny app with interactive features</br>

# Application Features
The application will consist of five main sections, one for each analysis approach.
