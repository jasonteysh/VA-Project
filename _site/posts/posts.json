With almost 3 million hosts listing over 7 million accommodations worldwide, Airbnb is popular with holidaymakers for the wide choice of rental accommodations catering to different needs.\r\nGiven the popularity of Airbnb to holidaymakers, people are also eager to list their accommodation for vacationers to hire.\r\nMotivation\r\nA common challenge for many hosts is how to price their listing competitively in comparison to other listings in the same locale. This project aims to provide an application for Airbnb hosts to identify whether they their prices are comparative to other accommodations, too high or too low.\r\nThe abundance of Airbnb data provides us with a great opportunity to perform clusters analysis and geospatial clustering of rental units within the geographical scope of this project. It also allows us to review variables that lead to better reviews and pricing stratgies through multilinear regression and text analysis.\r\nSuch analysis could benefit potential hosts and policymakers, ensuring there is a balance between commercial and residential units in the property market.\r\nProject Objectives\r\nDevelop an interactive application for end-users\r\nVisual representation of accommodation listings by region\r\nTimeline of Project\r\nOur project timeline will be as follows:\r\nTimeline\r\nProposed Scope and Methodology\r\nThis project will focus on Australia as the location of interest.\r\n\r\nThe methodologies that will be used are:\r\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\r\nCluster Analysis\r\nText Analytics\r\nDevelopment of an R-shiny app with interactive features\r\nApplication Features\r\nThe application will consist of five main sections, one for each analysis approach. Exploratory Data Analysis Cluster Analysis Spatial Cluster Analysis Text Analysis Multilinear Regression Analysis\r\nSoftware Tool\r\nTha interactive application, together with all documentation such as this project proposal and the final report will be written in R using RStudio.\r\nR Packages\r\nThese are the R packages used:\r\nClustGeo: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ClustGeo\r\ncorrplot: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot\r\ndendextend https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dendextend\r\nDT: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DT\r\nGGally: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGally\r\nggdendro: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdendro\r\nGWmodel: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GWmodel\r\nleaflet: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet\r\nplotly: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly\r\nRColorBrewer: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer\r\nrgdal: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal\r\nrgeos: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgeos\r\nsf: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf\r\nshiny: https://shiny.rstudio.com\r\nshinythemes: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinythemes\r\nshinyWidgets: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinyWidgets\r\nsp: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp\r\nspdep: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep\r\ntidyverse: https://www.tidyverse.org\r\ntmap: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap\r\nTeam Members\r\nLouelle TEO Fengmin\r\nJason TEY Shou Heng\r\nWONG Kian Hoong (Andy)\r\nReferences\r\nAirbnb, Inc.\r\n2021 Airbnb Statistics: Usage, Demographics, and Revenue Growth\r\nAustralian region boundaries in Tableau\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
